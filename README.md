# LINE-FOLLOWER-BOT

> Working of line follower is very interesting. Line follower robot senses black line by using a sensor and then sends the signal to Arduino.  At that point, Arduino drives the engine as indicated by sensors' yield.
> Here in this project we are using two IR sensor modules namely left sensor and right sensor. When both left and right sensor senses white then robot move forward.
## Basic Working 
![]()
> If left sensor comes on black line then robot turn left side.
![]()
> If right sensor sense black line then robot turn right side until both 
![]()
> Sensor comes at white surface. When white surface comes robotstarts moving on forward again.
![]()
> If both sensors comes on black line, robot stops.

## COMPONENTS USED
### Arduino Uno
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328.It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs and 6 can be used as analog inputs), a 16 MHz resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an in-circuit system programming ICSP) header and a reset button.

### Metal Chassis
The base of our bot on which every component is assembled. 
### 6V DC Motors
Gear Motors 2 units, in addition, a freewheel in front.

## Moter Drivers
Motor drivers act as an interface between the motors and the control circuits.

### IR Sensor
An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings. ... These types of sensors measure only infrared radiation, rather than emitting it that is called a passive IR sensor.
